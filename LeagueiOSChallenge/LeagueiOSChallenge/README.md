Tech Stack
Language: Swift 6.2
Framework: UIKit
Networking: URLSession (No third-party libraries)
Architecture: MVC with SOLID principles
Testing: XCTest
Installation
Prerequisites
Xcode 15+
iOS 18.3 simulator or physical device
Swift Package Manager (SPM) for dependency management
Steps
open zip file
cd LeagueiOSChallenge
Open in Xcode
bash
Copy
Edit
open LeagueiOSChallenge.xcodeproj
Run the app
Select iPhone 15 Simulator (or physical device).
Press Command + R to build and run.
Assumptions
No third-party libraries are allowed, so all networking is done using URLSession.
If no username or password is provided, a random API key is generated.
Guest users cannot log out, but they can exit the app.
The API may return dummy data, so actual user authentication is not enforced.
Future Improvements
ðŸš€ Enhance UI Design

Improve layout with auto-layout refinements
Add animations for smooth transitions
ðŸ“Œ Better State Management

Use Combine or SwiftData for better data handling
Implement offline caching for posts
ðŸ”’ Security & Authentication

Secure API keys using Keychain
Implement OAuth for real authentication
ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization

Use background threading for API calls
Implement lazy loading for images
Architecture & Design
1. MVC Pattern
Models: Represent data structures
Views: Handle UI elements
Controllers: Manage business logic and user interaction
2. SOLID Principles Applied
âœ… Single Responsibility - Each class has a clear purpose
âœ… Open-Closed - Code is extendable without modification
âœ… Dependency Inversion - Services are injected instead of hardcoded
